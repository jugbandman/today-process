## How This Works

**Daily → Backlog:**
When you don't finish something and it's not urgent, push it here with a date:
```
- [ ] Research CRM options (pushed 2026-01-08)
```

**Weekly Review:**
Every week, Claude prompts you to review items that have been sitting:
- 7+ days in To Review → decide: pull forward, keep, or archive
- Recurring skips → "You've pushed this 3 times - still relevant?"

**Backlog → Daily:**
When you're ready to tackle something, move it to today.md.

## Staleness Alerts

Claude tracks how long items sit:

| Duration | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| 7+ days | Flagged in weekly review |
| 14+ days | "This has been here 2 weeks - archive?" |
| 3+ pushes | "You keep deferring this" |
