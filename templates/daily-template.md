## End of Day Actions

When you finish for the day, tell Claude:

```
End my day. Review what got done, help me decide what to
carry forward vs push to backlog, and note tomorrow's focus.
```

Claude will:
1. Check off completed items
2. Ask about incomplete items: "Carry to tomorrow or push to backlog?"
3. Add pushed items to `_backlog.md` with today's date
4. Update "Tomorrow's focus"
