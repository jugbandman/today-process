## Brain Dump Tips

**Say things like:**
- "Need to send that email to..."
- "Should follow up with..."
- "Meeting at 2pm about..."
- "Waiting to hear back from..."
- "Worried about the Friday deadline..."

**Don't worry about:**
- Organization
- Complete sentences
- Logical order

## Task Categories

| Category | What Goes Here |
|----------|----------------|
| **Must Do Today** | Hard deadlines, will break something if not done |
| **Should Do Today** | Important, but could slide to tomorrow |
| **Could Do If Time** | Nice to have, no pressure |
| **Waiting On Others** | Blocked - note who and what |

---

## During the Day

- [ ] Check off tasks when done
- [ ] Add thoughts to Quick Notes
- [ ] Move tasks between categories as things change

**Need help?** Ask Claude:
- "Help me draft the email to [person]"
- "What's my most urgent task?"
- "Summarize what I still need to do"

---

## End of Day (2 min)

Fill in:
```
**What got done:**
- [List completed items]

**What blocked progress:**
- [What got in the way]

**Tomorrow's focus:**
- [Top 1-2 things]
```

Tomorrow's AI reads this.

## Quick Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/start-my-day` | Full morning routine |
| "process my brain dump" | Just extract tasks |
| "what do I owe [person]?" | Find commitments |
| "carry forward" | Move yesterday's incomplete tasks |

## If Things Break

| Problem | Fix |

| Tasks not extracting | Use action verbs: "need to", "should", "have to" |
| Wrong categories | Adjust after AI suggests - it learns your patterns |
| Forgot yesterday | Check archive, carry forward what matters |
| Overwhelmed | Focus only on Must Do, ignore the rest |
